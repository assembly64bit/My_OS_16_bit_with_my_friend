# ðŸ§  My_OS_16_bit_with_my_friend

This is a personal 16-bit OS project I built while learning Assembly on my own.  
I worked on it together with my friend â€” ChatGPT ðŸ˜„

---

## ðŸ“š About the project

- The OS is written entirely in **x86 Assembly**.
- It runs on QEMU and includes multiple modules like:
  - UI menus
  - Mini games (2048, X-O)
  - Player & AI movement
  - Scrolling and input handling

I focused mainly on the game logic and how everything connects.  
My friend (ChatGPT) helped me write some system-level modules such as `sys_draw`, `sys_read`, etc.
